Why use over array? 
Bc arrays need to have their size compiled at compile time (size unchanging during runtime)
use [] to read individual elements
if vector is full, and you add a value, it will auto increase size

#include <vector>

vector<int> myVector; // vector of ints
vector<double> myDVector; // vector of doubles
vector<string> mySVector; // vector of strings
vector<int*> intme; // vector of int pointers
vector<int> vec(10); // set initial size  to 10
vector<int> vec(10, 2); // set size to 10, all elements = 2

vec.push_back(x); // stores 'x' at the last element in vec
vec.pop_back(); // removes last element in vec
vec.clear(); // completely removes elemetns in vec


sizeof(); // shows size of thing in bytes
pointers are 64bit
