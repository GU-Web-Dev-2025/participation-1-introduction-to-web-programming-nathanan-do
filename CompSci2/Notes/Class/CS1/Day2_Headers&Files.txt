FileIO
(include, declare, open, use, then close)
#include <fstream>
ifstream: for input from a files
ofstream: for outsput to a files
fstream: input and output to a file

Define stream: streams are bools (if open set to true, closed is set to false)
fstream infile;

infile.open("text.txt");
outfile.open

infile.close();
outfile.close

outfile << "texts and" << variables;

Good convention: when using a file, use a "const string" s.t. the file name will not change unlesss you change it at the declaration
