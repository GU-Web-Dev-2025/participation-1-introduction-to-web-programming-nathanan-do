-if the two numbers in mailbox 9 and 10 are the same, output 1, else output 0

Program5:
-same as program4, except user inputs from user

Program6:
-LMC program from lecture slides checking if x > 10
-- if x > 10 output 0, else output 1

Program7:
-LMC program from lecture slides, countdown from input value
    to 1. e.g. if user inputs 7, countdown from 7 to 1.
